# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the creation of a Todo app with React. Currently, it only displays the tasks in a list (like the example on React's main page). But I'm planning to add a tiemr to record the time in pomodoros. (That's why the todos have 4 red circles)

**Thoughts:** I struggled with css. For me, it's really hard, I didn't know how to align the elementes in the todo and after trial and error I finally did it (kind of). I also struggled with the events and passing data from a child component to the parent, I didn't know how to do it so I followed the example on React's main page. Because it was my first time in a long time doing react and styling with css, I was slowed down.

### Day 2: July 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress*: I am keep working on a todo app. I reorganized my code so that the data of the app stays in the App Component and also delegated the creation form to its own componente. With this new organization, I created a detail view components where the timer, and the edit function are supposed to be.

**Thoughts** I completed the exercises about react on Freecodecamp. I now have a better understanding of the react and the pattern of having your data in only on component, I didn't understand the last part of converting a react component into a string in the server, though. I'll continue reading the documentation of reacct because I also didn't quite grasp the events lifecycle.

## Day 3: July 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress*: I added style to the todos and fixed a bug a found, I also added a header that displays the date and the time.

**thoughts**: I still don't know what the best form to add style is in react.

## Day 4: July 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I only had time to split up the code.

**thoughts**: Seeing the watchlist of react conf makes me feel as though I knew nothing about react.

## Day 5: July 11th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I combined threejs and react js to start doing my lisssajous project.

**thoughts**: I also read somthing about hooks aned now I know that don't know anything.

## Day 6: July 12th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I added a pomodoro timer to my project but it is not linked to the todos yet.

**thoughts**: I saw some really amazing projects implemented in react and they look gorgeous. That made me think that I should really improve my css skills.
