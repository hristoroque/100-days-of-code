# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the creation of a Todo app with React. Currently, it only displays the tasks in a list (like the example on React's main page). But I'm planning to add a tiemr to record the time in pomodoros. (That's why the todos have 4 red circles)

**Thoughts:** I struggled with css. For me, it's really hard, I didn't know how to align the elementes in the todo and after trial and error I finally did it (kind of). I also struggled with the events and passing data from a child component to the parent, I didn't know how to do it so I followed the example on React's main page. Because it was my first time in a long time doing react and styling with css, I was slowed down.
